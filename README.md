# Data Acquisition and Remotely Logged Home Automation System
Project 2 repository for APES ECEN 5013
A multithreaded home automation system in which, BeagleBone(BBG) is used as a remote logger system while TIVA acts as a sensor hub. The sensor hub collects data values from different sensors and sends them to BBG over UART communication

### Execution
* Use Code Composer Studio for the Tiva part of the project. Just build and run..
* Use make for BBG part
